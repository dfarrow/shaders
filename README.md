# shaders
These are some custom unity shaders.

BlendAdvanced - Allows you to smoothly transition between a base texture and an overlay texture using a slider value that can be controlled via script. 
This is good for something like showing a damage layer slowly fade in, having a dirt/wear layer blend in over time, etc. Supports normal, specular, metallic, and emission maps.

BlendComposite - Allows you to composite up to 3 texture layers. This is useful for putting varied decals/graffiti/signs on buildings/objects, compositing uniforms over characters
with custom logos/patches/etc. Supports normal, specular, metallic, and emission maps.
